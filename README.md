# My path

## The begining

At the end of 2019 I began my adventure as a developer learning to create Android applications as a hobby. A few months later I had the opportunity to redesign the website of a company with which I continue to collaborate today.

## The past

 While I learned how to develop Android apps, I decide to focus on trying to create an app to track stock and cryptocurrency prices. I call the project PayAll (Very creative, right?).
After successfully tracking the price of the assets, I try to allow users to buy and sell these assets through the application. Obviously it didn't work out due to the huge legal and technical challenges that a service like that requires, but it helped me a lot to learn about programming, cloud, APIs and Cloud Servers.
Even publish the app on Play Store. But like I said, it was a big challenge for a beginner. This also helped me learn about web development.

A few years later I have my first real project. A personal blog for a friend where they can post articles about politics. I developed the platform using PHP and MYSQL, but at this point I was still a beginner who basically learned with tutorials that helped fill the gap, but not much else.
At this point I realize that programming requires a lot more than tutorials and I start to learn the basics of JavaScript, which leads me to learn about documentation, environments and more technical information.

Then I met Electron. Developing desktop applications using web technologies fascinated me.
Then I met Typescript and fell in love, having control of the data type and having more control over the flow of data within a system seemed much better to me.

More recently I discovered libraries like React that allow you to develop web pages using components that greatly automate development. It blew me away. I also discovered ThreeJS, a library that allows you to display 3D components with shadows, textures, and much more control. I think it's a great option to give a very high level of quality detail to websites (although at the moment I haven't developed anything with this library yet, it's clearly on my to-do list).

Obviously during all this time I learned about SEO, good optimization practices, Analytics, Marketing and even at a higher level about configuring cloud servers to display web applications and services.

## The Present

I am currently focused on developing applications that run on the web using cloud services to keep user information synchronized at all times.

Datasync (again, creativity giving its best, right?) is a web application that aims to empower its users with tools for productivity and daily use.

The goal of the project is to allow users to access a personal computer in the cloud. No matter where you are or what device you connect from, your files are there ready for you to continue working on what you need accompanied by a wide variety of free tools that don't put limits on you and without those annoying ads. (Obviously the finances of this project will be a big challenge)

This project also represents a challenge in the security aspect.
I can safely say that the most advanced applications of the project currently are the email client, the cloud storage system, and the document, image and video editors.
At the same time, I am developing a plugin for operating systems that allows any Datasync application to be opened directly from an external window, removing the limitation of displaying the application in a single web browser tab.
And to top it all off, I have the silly idea of allowing users to have an intelligent assistant that uses the voice of interpreters (Influencers and Artists) to inform the user about messages, events or even manage applications using natural language.

It is a great challenge and project. It represents great challenges in multiple areas such as security and optimization. Every day that I delve deeper into the development of this project, I learn new concepts that are undoubtedly necessary to fully understand to throw garbage.

Will I be able to complete this project without losing my mind or ending up bankrupt? I think the only thing left is to continue giving everything to increase the chances of success.
